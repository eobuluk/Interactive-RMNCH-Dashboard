# Interactive RMNCH Dashboard: Visualising Key Maternal and Child Health Indicators
## Objective
This project focused on creating an interactive reproductive, maternal, new-born, and child health (RMNCH) dashboard to monitor critical health indicators and inform data-driven decisions. The dashboard provided program managers and officers with actionable insights to evaluate healthcare performance, identify gaps, and track progress across districts and regions.

## Key features and insights:
### The following key indicators were visualized:
- Antenatal Care (ANC): Trends in early and 1st ANC visit coverage.
- District-wise coverage of early and 1st ANC visits: 4th ANC visit coverage trends and district-level insights.
- Health Unit Deliveries: Coverage trends over time and comparisons by district.
- Postnatal Care (PNC): Attendance at 6 weeks coverage trends and district-level analysis.
- Mortality Metrics: Institutional perinatal mortality rates vs. perinatal deaths, Institutional maternal mortality rates vs. maternal
deaths.

### The following interactive features were included:
- Filters for region, district, and period allowed users to tailor the dashboard to specific needs.
- Dynamic visualizations included line charts, bar charts, and comparative scatter plots to illustrate trends and relationships
effectively.
- Organized indicators into sections for easy navigation, including antenatal care, maternal health, postnatal care, and mortality
metrics.
- Combined multiple insights into a single, cohesive dashboard for efficiency and practicality.
Outcome:

## Tools and technologies used:
Excel: Developed the dashboard using advanced features such as pivot tables, charts, and interactive slicers to create a user-friendly and dynamic interface.
